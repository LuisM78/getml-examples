A real-world example project using the consumer expenditure (CE) data
set which will guide you through the Python API of **getML**.

A low-level introduction to the Python API can be found in
[getting_started.ipynb](getting_started.ipynb) and the corresponding
Python script in [getting_started.py](getting_started.py).

For more information about the data set as well as a more thorough
explanation of its analysis can be found in the
[consumer_expenditure](../consumer_expenditure/) project.
