Present in this folder are both the converted data sets `CE_*` used in
the [getting started
guide](/python/projects/getting_started/getting_started.ipynb) as well
as the original data in [raw](raw/) which you can also find
[online](https://www.bls.gov/cex/pumd_data.htm) (diary15.zip). Check
out the corresponding [conversion script](raw/convert_CE_data.py) to
