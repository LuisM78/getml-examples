Present in this folder are both the converted data sets `CE_*` used in
the [getting started
guide](/python/projects/consumer_expenditure/consumer_expenditure.ipynb)
as well as the original data in [raw](/data/consumer_expenditure/raw/)
which you can also find
[online](https://www.bls.gov/cex/pumd_data.htm) (diary15.zip). Check
out the corresponding [conversion script](raw/convert_CE_data.py) to
learn about the preprocessing steps necessary in order to use the CE
data.
